Instructions:

This tutorial is designed for those interested in learning the basics of git. It aims to introduce, and then reinforce the basics of version control using git. Googling and reading up more is required by design.

But first, a short history of version control:

GUI:

You can choose to use a GUI or a CLI (terminal, command prompt, etc). A GUI can be useful to help visualise branches and commit history, but everything a GUI does can be done using command line. I recommend using the command line as far as possible because it is more precise and "pure", but you can choose to checkout (free) GUIs such as Sourcetree and GitKraken.

Basic commands you should know:

git init 
git add [filename]
git add .
git commit -m "message here"
git push
git pull
git merge
git log 
git status 
git checkout [branch name]
git checkout -b "new branch name"
